<h1>Large Prime Finder</h1>

<p>Large Prime Finder includes small simple example programs that are capable of
finding prime numbers that have tens or hunreds of digits.

<p>The first example is the resumable prime finder which calculates numbers that
are prime and writes them to a file called "primes". To compile and run do:

<code><pre>
    make resumable-prime-finder
    ./resumable-prime-finder
</pre></code>
  
<p>The progam will run until killed (control-c) or it finds the last prime that
will fit in an unsigned 64 bit number.

<p>Upon start, the resumable prime finder will start looking for prime numbers
larger than the number at the end of the primes file.

<p>Try it right now in a Cloud Shell virtual machine:
